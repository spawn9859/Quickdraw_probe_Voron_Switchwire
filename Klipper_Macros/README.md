The macros are working on official Klipper firmware.

You first need to enter the parameters for the dock variables. The values that are in the config file are the values I use with my Switchwire. You can still use this config file if you use non-modified probe at Annex Engineering. If you do, you'll want to change the value for variable_detach from 1 to 2.

You need to add [include dock_macros.cfg] in your printer.cfg file

The dock is best printed with adaptative layer height or a 0.1mm layer height.

The modified carriage can be found at Annex Engineering here : https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Quickdraw_Probe/tree/main/XY_Carriages_for_Non-Annex_Printers/VORON_SW/Afterburner%2BMagnetic_Probe_X_Carriage

Do take note that you'll lose 27mm on the X axis for a dock located at X250

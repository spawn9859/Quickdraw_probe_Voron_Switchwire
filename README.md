# Quickdraw_probe_Voron_Switchwire
A Magnetically Coupled, Removable, Z Probe and Dock System remixed from the files at Annex Engineering so the probe detaches in the X axis on the Voron Switchwire.

For the dock and probe you will find here, you'll need :
* 6x 6x3mm magnets
* Omron D2F-5 microswitch
* 2x M2x10mm screws

Modified carriage, dock arm and other infos can be found at Annex Engineering : https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Quickdraw_Probe
